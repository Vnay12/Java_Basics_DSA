**Hashmap**

Q) if you want to find the frequency of any number in array like how many times it occured 
A) Brute Force:
1) we will keep a counter 
2) we will check that number appears and then we increase counter 
3) it will take O(N) and as we do for all the number it will take N^2
4) hence in this case we will create an array of indexing the element 
5) an array: 1 3 4 8 9 12
6) then we will make array of 13 will initilising it to 0 and then increase the frequency 
7) and this will only take O(N) times
